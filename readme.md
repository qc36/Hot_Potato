The game that will be modeled is called hot potato, in which there are some number of players
who quickly toss a potato from one player to another until, at a random point, the game ends
and the player holding the potato is “it”. The object is to not be the one holding the potato at the
end of the game. In this assignment, you will create a ring of “player” processes that will pass
the potato around. Thus, each player process has a left neighbor and a right neighbor. Also,
there will be a “ringmaster” process that will start each game, report the results, and shut down
the game.

To begin, the ringmaster creates a “potato” object, initialized with some number of hops and
sends the potato to a randomly selected player. Each time a player receives the potato, it will
decrement the number of hops and append the player’s ID to the potato. If the remaining
number of hops is greater than zero, the player will randomly select a neighbor and send the
potato to that neighbor. The game ends when the hop counter reaches zero. The player
holding the potato sends it to the ringmaster, indicating the end of the game. The ringmaster
prints a trace of the game to the screen (using the player identities that are appended to the
potato), and shuts the game down (by sending a message to each player to indicate they may
shut down as the game is over).

Each player will establish three network socket connections for communication with the player
to the left, the player to the right, the ringmaster. The potato can arrive on any of these three
channels. Commands and important information may also be received from the ringmaster.
The ringmaster will have N network socket connections. At the end of the game, the ringmaster
will receive the potato from the player who is “it”.

The assignment is to create one ringmaster process and some number of player processes,
then play a game and terminate all the processes gracefully. You may explicitly create each
process from an interactive shell; however, the player processes must exit cleanly at the end of
the game in response to commands from the ringmaster.

Communication Mechanism

The ringmaster program is invoked as shown below, where
num_players must be greater than 1 and num_hops must be greater than or equal to zero
and less than or equal to 512 (make sure to validate your command line arguments!).

ringmaster <port_num> <num_players> <num_hops>
The player program is invoked as:
player <machine_name> <port_num>

where machine_name is the machine name (e.g. login-teer-03.oit.duke.edu) where the
ringmaster process is running and port_num is the port number given to the ringmaster
process which it uses to open a socket for player connections. If there are N players, each
player will have an ID of 0, 1, 2, to N-1. A player’s ID and other information that each player will
need to connect to their left and right neighbor can be provided by the ringmaster as part of
setting up the game. The players are connected in the ring such that the left neighbor of player i
is player i-1 and the right neighbor is player i+1. Player 0 is the right neighbor of player N-1,
and Player N-1 is the left neighbor of player 0.
Zero is a valid number of hops. In this case, the game must create the ring of processes. After
the ring is created, the ringmaster immediately shuts down the game.

Output:

The following describes all the output of the ringmaster program. Do not have any other
output.

Initially:
Potato Ringmaster
Players = <number>
Hops = <number>

Upon connection with a player (i.e. each player should send some initial message to the
ringmaster to indicate that it is ready and possibly provide other information about that player):
Player <number> is ready to play
When launching the potato to the first randomly chosen player:
Ready to start the game, sending potato to player <number>

When it gets the potato back (at the end of the game). The trace is a comma separated list of
player numbers. No spaces or newlines in the list.
Trace of potato:
<n>,<n>, …

The following describes all the output of the player program. Do not have any other output.
After receiving an initial message from the ringmaster to tell the player the total number of
players in the game, and possibly other information (e.g. info about that player’s neighbors):
Connected as player <number> out of <number> total players

When forwarding the potato to another player:
Sending potato to <number>
When number of hops is reached:
I’m it
